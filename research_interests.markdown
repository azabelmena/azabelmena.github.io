### A note on Research Interests
This is by no means a comprehensive list of _everything_ I am interested, rather
as exhaustive a list I can make without overwhelming the reader with various
topics. Each research interest is hyperlinked so that clicking on it will take
you to another webpage providing a description of what that topic covers. I have
tried to consolidate descriptions to [one area specifically](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/)
however, I have had to branch out to other websites for some explanations. If
you find a website that gives a much better explanation of one of the topics,
feel free to send me the link through the
contacts.
