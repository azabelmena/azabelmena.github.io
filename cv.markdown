# Teaching Experience
- Proyecto Tutorías DECEP
    - 2020 -- 2021
    - University of Puerto Rico
    - Mathematics Tutor
        - Conducted assessments to identify the educational needs of my students
          and developed individualized learning plans.
        - Tasked with providing tutoring services to seven high school students
          for 10 hours a week in the subjects of Algebra and Pre-Calculus.

- Self Employed
    - 2019-2021
    - Mathematics Tutor
        - Evaluated students learning styles and provided appropriate techniques
          for maximizing understanding and minimizing frustration.

        - Simplified math concepts while coaching students to think critically
          when problem solving; eventually introducing them to axiomatic systems
          within mathematics.

        - Provided tutoring one-on-one to five highschool students in the
          subjects of Algebra, Pre-Calculus, and Geometry for two times a week, at
          two hours for each session.
