I am thinking of starking a [zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/).
The purpose of the zettelkasten would just to link mathematics
definitions from various topics for my personal use. Of course, anyone
else would be free to use it as well. I think, perhaps, I would link
it a seperate webpage with a different theme. I need to look up more
on how to set it up. A collegue of mine has it set up with a graph
which would be nice. More on this endeavor later.
