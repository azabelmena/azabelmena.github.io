Turns out, setting up a zettelkasten is much harder work. I'm not even
talking about writing one. I'm just talking about linking one website
to the other website and dealing with DNS shenanegans. You'll notice
that the link to "zettelkasten" on my homepage still gives a 404 file not
found error. This _should_ be resolved soon.
