I am a graduate student enrolled in the Master’s program in the Department of
Mathematics at the University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras (UPRRP). I am an
aspiring mathematician who wishes to focus on research and education. Research
interests include topics in the fields of algebra, cryptography, and coding
theory.

## What you can find here.
- This about page, describing me, with this really old picture.
- My Curriculum Vitae. This one is self explanatory, it's just my CV
  in web format. Here you'll also be able to download a PDF version.
  **Disclaimer**: As of now, this page is horribly out of date. I will
  update it when I have the time.
- A page describing my mathematics notes. You will not find the
  actual notes on this page, rather the github repository linking to
  them. I describe how to compile the notes on this page.
- Research interests. This is also self explanatory. This is just a
  page where I list various research areas in mathematics that I am
  interested in pursuing, if I am not already researching those areas.
  I give hyperlinks to pages explaining each area (where applicable).
- A [_Zibaldone_](https://www.ivanseymus.com/on-keeping-a-zibaldone-commonplace-book/)
which where you can find math jokes, quotes, observations, and
(short) reflections and one-off throughs (transcribed directly from my
physical notebooks of course). This should not be confused with a
[commonplace notebook](https://imperfectjournaling.com/commonplace-book/).
which is more structured. Here the only structure you'll find are
time-stamps. If you want to learn more about zibaldones and commonplace books,
[Park Notes](https://www.youtube.com/@ParkerNotes) on youtube is a great resource.
He also has a [substack](https://parknotes.substack.com/).
- I will possibly, add a blog to record thoughts which are too big for
  the Zibaldone to contain. I'm still not certain on this.

## About the Slogan Below.

"Mathematics for Fun and Profit". This is just a riff on Aleph One's
article ["Smashing the Stack For Fun and Profit"](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs161/fa08/papers/stack_smashing.pdf).
This paper is just an overview of stack smashing vulernabilities common in the `C` programming language, and it's very much worth reading.
