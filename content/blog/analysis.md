My relationship with mathematical analysis is, frought... to say the
least. Let's get one thing clear, I am first, and foremost, an
algebraist. So when I have to deal with mathematical analysis,
particularly, real analysis, I tend to get pretty worked up. This is
an inline math equation: \(x^2+y^2=1\). Here is another (un-labeled)
math equation in block form:
\[
\begin{equation*}
    x^2+y^2=1
\end{equation*}
\]
Now, here is some text in a math environment:
\[
\text{This is some text!!!}
\]
Here is another (labeled) math equation:
\[
\begin{equation}
    \zeta(s)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty{\frac{1}{n^s}}
\end{equation}
\]
Here are some labeled and unlabeled align blocks:
\[
\begin{align}
    x^2+y^2-1 &=  0   \\
    yx^2+zy^2-1 &=  0   \\
\end{align}
\]

\[
\begin{align*}
    f(x) &= x^2-1   \\
    g(x) &= y^2+1   \\
\end{align*}
\]
Finally, here is some math in a block without any environment:
\[
    f(x)=\int_a^x{D{f(t)} \ dt}
\]
