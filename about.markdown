I am a graduate student enrolled in the Master’s program in the Department of
Mathematics at the University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras (UPRRP). I am an
aspiring mathematician who wishes to focus on research and education. Research
interests include topics in the fields of algebra, cryptography, and coding
theory.
